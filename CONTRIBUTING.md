## 🌿 Branch Naming Convention
Use the following format for all branches:
- `name/short-description`

**Examples:**
- `feature/homepage-layout`
- `fix/responsive-navbar`
- `update/readme-links`

---

## 🧩 Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** from `development` before starting any work.
2. Implement your feature or fix.
3. **Commit messages** should be clear and use present tense.  
   Example: `Add sidebar toggle functionality`
4. **Push** your branch and open a **Pull Request (PR)** into the `development` branch.
5. Each PR must be **reviewed by 2 team members** before merging.
6. Once approved and tested, it will be merged into `development`.
7. When all features are stable, `development` is merged into `main` (production).

---

## 🔍 Code Review
- Every pull request **must** be reviewed by **two different team members**.  
- Reviewers check for:
  - Code readability and clarity
  - Functionality correctness
  - HTML/CSS/JS best practices
  - Responsiveness
- Reviewers should leave constructive feedback or approve the PR.

---

## 🧪 Testing
- After code review, **one team member** is responsible for testing the feature in the **development environment**.
- Testing includes:
  - Verifying that all links, menus, and pages work
  - Checking responsiveness on mobile/tablet/desktop
  - Ensuring there are no console errors
- **Any bug found on production = automatic fail** (as per assignment rules).

---

## 📅 Scrum & Collaboration
- Use the **Miro Scrum Board** to track all tickets:
  - Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Code Review → Testing → Done
- Every task must:
  - Have a clear description and acceptance criteria
  - Be code reviewed and tested
- Each team member participates in:
  - Coding
  - Code reviewing
  - Testing
- One **Sprint Retrospective** must be held to improve team efficiency.
